[Git Repository](https://github.com/BigAlzzz/T1A3)

# **Welcome to my BlackJack terminal.**

## Purpose

The purpose of this application is to apply Python foundations learnt from Coders Academy to a terminal application.

## Features

## Implementation Plan

The software Trello was used to develop an implementation plan.
The Trello board was split into 3 stages.
- To do list
- Doing list
- Done list
  
Below is an example of the process of an implementation plan from to do list to done.
- The to do list.
The to do list was where most of the brain storming happened. Initially two ideas came into mind, a Wordle app and a Blackjack app. The Blackjack app was selected as the logic of the app seemed simple at that time. The assessment rubric and requirements were used to setup the to do list. The application needed 3 features, initially only was could come into mind, the BlackJack game setup and the BlackJack game play. The third feature the game menu was only brought up later in the week after discussion with the educators.

The first feature, the game setup, with 5 or more items.
- The setup of the cards, there needed to be 52 cards with 4 suits.
- The deck needed to be randomised
- The dealer had a “hand” and the player had a “hand”
- The game starts with two cards being dealt to both “hands”.
- Dealer had 1 card revealed and 1 card hidden
- Player had both cards revealed.
- A reminder to make code DRY and to make use of loops, classes and functions.
Each one of these options then had their separate cards and were placed in the doing section.
- A tag was given to the card to indicate how difficult the task would be.
- Once completed card is moved into Done and the ticked off the checklist of the Feature.
- Date of completion is also selected
- The options also had a flow of pseudo code in mind
  
Doing list to Done list.
- On the day the feature is split into individual cards
- The cards are roughly given a pomodoro length to finish.
- If required more or less time is given.
- When a task is completed the individual card it marked off and placed in the Done section
- The checklist is ticked off in the main feature card.
- Once all the options are ticked off the card is moved into the done list.
- In the doing list a reminder of DRY and Pep8 styling remains constant until code was finished.
